1.Sam's new maths teacher is very enthusiastic about making sure that students understand the concept rather than remembering it. On her first day at teaching, she gives an assignment to all the students to test their potential. Sam wants to demonstrate that he understands the concept rather than rote learning. Help Sam in doing this by solving the hardest problem in the assignment. The problem is written as follows.

A perfect function is defined in the following manner.

F(x, y) = x2+ y for 1 ≤ x ≤ A, 1 ≤ y ≤ B
F(x, y) = 2 otherwise
Find the number of integral pairs (x, y) such that F(x, y) is a perfect square.

Input
First and the only line of the input contains two single space separated integers A and B.

Output
Output a single integer indicating the output to the only test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106
Example
Input:
4 4

Output:
1



Explanation
Example case 1. (1, 3) is the only pair such that x = 1, y = 3 satisfying x <= 4 and y <= 4. 1^2 + 3 = 4 which is a perfect square.








































2.Sam is an incredible magician. He has prepared an extraordinary magic trick which he calls as the biggest achievement of his life. He will be performing this magic trick for the first time in the K-Pop World Festival. He is nervous and wants to make sure that everything goes well. His magic trick consists of N acts labeled from 1 to N. Every act except act 1 is directly dependent upon the successful execution of exactly one of the previous acts. The act i is said to be dependent upon act j iff -

act i is directly dependent upon the act j (j < i) or
act i is dependent upon some act x which is dependent upon the act j. (j < x < i)
An act can never happen if one or more of its dependencies failed. Note that not happening is not the same as failing. Also, every act has an associated value ai which gets added to the audience's anger if that act fails. If the anger becomes very large, people will start throwing sharp objects at Sam.

Since he is going to perform in the K-Pop World Festival, he is interested in knowing the minimum possible anger value of audience in the hypothetical situation where he was able to successfully execute exactly K acts during his performance. This means that the remaining acts either failed or could not happen (because of the dependency constraints).

Input
The first line contains a single interger T - the number of testcases.

For each testcase,

The first line contains two space separated integers N and K.

The following N-1 lines contain the information about the acts 2 to N. ith of these lines contains two space separated integers pi (pi < i+1) and ai- This means that the (i+1)th act is directly dependent upon the pith act and adds ai to the anger value.

Output
For each testcase, print a line containing the minimum anger value of audience if Sam could perform exactly K of the acts successfully.

Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤2000

1≤K≤N

1≤ai≤109




Sample Input
1
5 3
1 5
2 4
2 6
3 8
Sample Output
4
Explanation
If Sam fails on act 3, a3 = 4 gets added to the audience's anger and the act 5 can never happen. This means only 3 acts 1,2 and 4 are successful.






























3.There are two players P1, P2 playing a game on an array A which has n positive integers: A1,A2,…,An. Both the players takes turns alternatively, and P1 goes first. Rules of the game are as follows.

In P1’s turn, he should choose any element Ai which is ≥1, and subtract 1 from it.
In P2’s turn, he should choose any element Ai which is ≥2, and subtract 2 from it.
The player who is not able to make a move loses. Given the array A, find the number of different indices i such that that P1 can subtract from Ai in his first turn, and end up winning the game, if both the players play optimally after this.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n.
The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers denoting the array A.
Output
For each test case, output an integer corresponding to the number of possible first moves of P1 that lead him to win.

Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤n≤105
1≤Ai≤105
Sum of n over all the test cases doesn't exceed 106
Example Input

Example Output
1
0
1
Explanation
Testcase 1: The array is {1}. P1 has no choice but to pick the element and subtract 1 from it. The resulting array is {0}, and now P2 is unable to make a move. Hence P1 wins, and there was only one winning first move. Hence the answer is 1.

Testcase 2: The array is {3}. P1 has no choice but to pick the element and subtract 1 from it. The resulting array is {2}, and now P2 has no choice but to subtract 2 from it. The resulting array is {0}, and now P1 is unable to make a move. Hence P1 loses.There is no starting move for P1 which leads to his victory. Hence the answer is 0.

Testcase 3: The array is {1, 2}. P1 has two choices. Either subtract 1 from 1 or subtract 1 from 2.

Suppose he subtracts 1 from the first element, then the resulting array is {0, 2}, and now P2 has no choice but to subtract 2 from the second element. The resulting array is {0, 0}, and now P1 is unable to make a move. Hence P1 loses in this case.
But suppose he subtracts 1 from the second element, then the resulting array is {1, 1}, and now P2 is unable to make a move. Hence P1 wins in this case.
Thus, there is exactly one starting move for P1 which leads to his victory. Hence the answer is 1.




























4.You are given a set of N strings S0, S1, …, SN-1. These strings consist of only lower case characters a..z and have the same length L.

A string H is said to be K-important if there are at least K strings in the given set of N strings appearing at K different positions in H. These K strings need not to be distinct.

Your task is to find the shortest K-important string. If there are more than one possible solution, your program can output any of them.

Input
The first line contains a number t (about 10) which is the number of test cases.

Each test case has the following form.

The first line contains three integers N, L and K. The next N lines contain the strings in the given set.

Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 150
1 ≤ L ≤ 300
1 ≤ K ≤ 500
Output
For each test case, output the following information.

The first line contains the length of the shortest K-important strings.

The second line contains H, one of the K-important strings.

Each line in the next K lines contains the index of one string in the given set that appears in H and the corresponding position (0-based) in H.

Print a blank line after each test case's output.

Find out maximum possible sum of all good disjoint pairs that can be made from these numbers.

Sum of X pairs is the sum of all 2*X numbers in the pairs.

Input
First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow.

First line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers: N and D.

Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers.

Output
For each test case, output the answer in a separate line.

Constraints

4 3
5 8 10 12
5 3
3 2 8 17 15




Output:

37
Explanation:
Test Case 1: You can only take 1 pair out of 3 numbers. So pair(3,5) is only valid pair whose difference is 2.

Test Case 3: You can take pairs(3,2) and (15,17) as the answer.

Note:
Pair (a,b) is disjoint with pair (c,d) if and only if indices of a, b, c and d in the array are distinct.





























6.You are given K indices, A[1], A[2], … , A[K].

The numbers in the permutation between indices A[1] and A2 form an increasing sequence, the numbers in the permutation between indices A[2] and A3 form a decreasing sequence, those between A[3] and A4 form an increasing sequence and so on.

Count the number of valid permutations.

Input:
There will be multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T. There follow 2*T lines, 2 lines for each test case. The first line for each test case contains the numbers N and K. The second line contains K space seperated numbers, ie. A[1] to A[K].
